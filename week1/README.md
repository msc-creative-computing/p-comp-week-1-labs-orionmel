The survive equipment
=================================================================================================================


The background: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future, because of the constant demand for human materials to the earth, the earth has become barren, the ambient temperature has become unpredictable, it is difficult to survive, people as the only living things on the earth need to have special equipment with the temperature of the protective clothing (named “survive equipment”) to carry out external activities.


The function of this survive equipment:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This device can maintain a suitable temperature for human survival for a certain period of time, but over time, the temperature inside the device will decrease, the device will initially display three lit cue lights, but when the temperature drops to 25 degrees (this is the most suitable temperature for human survival), it will turn off a lamp, until the light is lowered to the last lamp (finally, when the temperature is below 5 degrees), the user must immediately find a survival base, the device need to be charged, but the last lamp will turn on the device's the thermostatic mechanism, The time of this thermostatic mechanism lasts only 30 seconds until all lights are finally turned off and the people inside the device die because the equipment is too cold.

The “affordance” of this survive equipment:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three warning lights are a way of connecting the user to the environment, the temperature inside the device is reduced because of the continuous low temperature of the external environment, and the temperature mechanism unique to the device is constantly approaching the external environment with time changes, three lights are the only way for the user to remind, people need to sense the reaction of the light through visual sense to give cognition feedback

Of course, this process need a  certain learning process, like Gibson and Pick (2003,p7) said, Affordances do not automatically present themselves to the actor. Instead, they typically must be discovered through perceptual learning, and actors must learn to use the affordances, which in some cases “…may require much exploration, patience, and time”

Finally, the use of visual reminders is not enough, after that, I will also consider using sound and feeling information for further thinking of the device.
