The Reflection Exercises
=========================

Q1: Reflect on creating interfaces for your body. Consider how we engage with tools – how does this impact how your body extends into the tools around you? What possibilities do you see?
----------------------------------------------

Mei:From the current lab experiments, I saw the different possibilities of using sensors to achieve creation. From the task of serial data, I learned how to use adunio and computer dialogue, ardunio is a good bridge to help us interact and communicate . From the study of photoresistors, I learned that I could interact differently depending on the light, that I could connect lights or buzzers to create different works. According to motion sensors, I can measure the distance between me and the machine, which reminds me of our current social distance rules due to the Cornavirus, and I can use this tool to control the distance between people.

I wondered whether we can use our heartbeats and heartbeat sensors to create, by not using the frequency of each heartbeat, so Convert this frequency to different sound frequencies, and at the same time, you can make an LED wearable necklace accessory. When the heart rate is different, the LED will also show different flashing effects. The way organs move inside our bodies can really be presented before our eyes, and converting the original human heartbeat frequency into a visualized new attachment to the body allows us to have a better understanding of our own body.

Q2:Consider what it means to have the skills to make this device. How does it impact, collide with, and alter your relationship with consumer interfaces?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mei ：These devices interact with the machine in terms of hearing, touch, vision, and so on, opening up more aspects of exploring the possibilities of interactive design. Before I knew about these sensors and the ardunio, my feelings about some mechanical classes were just stuck in some basic interface design and interaction behavior, and there was a deep resistance barrier to the underlying structure, but when I came into contact with them, the resistance barrier gradually dissipated.

I think the consumer interface of the future is not only the current popular mobile interface(phone\web\machine\AI\VR), but also some physically invisible interface system, I imagine that in the future if our eyes are a form of interactive interface, when our eyes turn to an object and stay for a long time, we can identify the object, thus transmitting basic information to the brain about that object.
So I think in the future we will be more intimate with some consumer interfaces, even integrated with the interface, interface is not our own use of external devices, but as part of our body to our perception and reception, this is a way for humans to understand themselves, but also the best way to interact, this should be a world of great disruption.
