## 4.Lab 04: Feedback systems
### Description:
Systems which feedback on themselves often feel more alive to us than static systems which only output data. Design a system, based on what we have learned so far, which feedbacks on itself. How could interaction work within a system which is continually feeding back on itself?

### Outcome:

According to Don Norman's affordance theory, I imagine a certain feedback mode in the future, and the entire city's work system is in the hands of the highest class people.<br>
The day and night in the city are no longer provided by the ecosystem, but by the buttons which in the hands of the controller: [left] [right] [down]. People use the urban environment to give feedback on their work day and night, but the controller controls the urban environment, creating a strange vicious circle
